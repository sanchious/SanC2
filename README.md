Simple Command and Control Server (C2)
Overview:
This project showcases the development of a Command and Control (C2) server implementedn with Python. A C2 server acts as a central hub for managing and controlling remote devices and/or connections. The server facilitates seamless communication between the control infrastructure and connected devices, enabling the execution of commands, data retrieval, and overall coordination.

Features:

Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, the server supports concurrent connections from multiple agents, making it suitable for managing extensive botnets or IoT device networks.

Command Execution: The server enables the execution of predefined commands on connected agents, providing control over various tasks and operations.

Data Retrieval: Agents can report back to the server, allowing the retrieval and storage of essential data, such as system and user information.

Persistence: The C2 server incorporates a persistence feature, enabling it to maintain communication with agents even after system reboots or network disruptions. This ensures continuous monitoring and control capabilities.

Tech Stack:
Python: Utilizes Python as the primary programming language for its simplicity and versatility.
Socket Programming: Relies on socket programming to establish communication channels between the server and agents.

Future Enhancements:
Secure Communication: The C2 server implements strong encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure secure communication with remote agents, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.

Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the sockserver.py script to start the C2 server.
Generate the payload and deploy payload.py to the target Windows, Linux or MacOs system and connect remote agents to the server using the provided client library.
